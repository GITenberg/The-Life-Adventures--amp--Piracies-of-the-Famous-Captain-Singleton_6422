description: "The Life, Adventures and Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton is\
  \ a novel by Daniel Defoe, originally published in 1720. It has been re-published\
  \ multiple times since, some of which times were in 1840 1927, 1972 and 2008. Captain\
  \ Singleton is believed to have been partly inspired by the exploits of the English\
  \ pirate Henry Every, who operated in the late 17th century.\nThe narrative describes\
  \ the life of the Englishman, Singleton, stolen from a well-to-do family as a child\
  \ and raised by Gypsies, eventually making his way to sea. The former half of the\
  \ book concerns Singleton's crossing of Africa, the latter half concerning his life\
  \ as a pirate in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Defoe's description of piracy\
  \ focuses for the most part on matters of economics and logistics, and Singleton's\
  \ pirate behaves more like a merchant adventurer, perhaps Defoe's comment on the\
  \ mercantilism of his day.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
